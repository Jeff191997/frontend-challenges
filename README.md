# 🧪 Frontend Challenges Practice

Welcome! This repository contains all my frontend practice projects, including challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) and other sources.

The goal is to strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design by building real UI components and layouts based on professional design specs.

I will continue adding new projects as I progress in my frontend journey.
